#basic_html_website
Jose Fernandez
In this website I had  some struggles and frustration dealing with codes and fixing errors/
it was also a thrilling excercise to be independent in basic web site coding structures and rules with html
Adding to the web I was not prepared to go to ahead of myself but i manage to fix some errors in-between each save before pusing it to github.

those Add ons' to the html website:
Internal CSS
***this became easy but confusing trying to set each individual style for attributes
table
***while i was able to code in a table and the rules, I was stuck with appling certain style elements into it
Internal images
***When it came to what would be faster to upload into the webpage. I decided to put a folder within the basic html folder for images only
Rendering images before adding path copy to the source tags.
***using a image player and sizing it down for the website
Playing with set of style colors
